The main concern of Vent is to connect event publishing with publisher adapters. Any transportation method is supported (given a publisher adapter is available), for example publishing to RabbitMQ, Log files and STDOUT. Multiple publishers are supported for events, so a message could be published from one place both to RabbitMQ, internally inside the application and the log file at the same time. Horray!}
